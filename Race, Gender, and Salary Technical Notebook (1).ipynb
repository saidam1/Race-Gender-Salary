    "In conclusion, this model was sufficient to predict the salary of Females and African Americans as there was not much error. The error that it faced are the rare cases of African Americans or females that end up making more than 50K without a second degree.\n",
    "The model gets a little tricked when it comes to evaluating the Caucassian race since there is a lot of reasons as a Caucassian would be able to make more than 50K, as seen even with just a high school degree even though the model predicts the Caucassians should be making less than 50K in reality they are capable of making more. \n",
    "This model may not be very accurate in predicting the salary of Caucassians, especially white men, however it could be approximately very close to predicting those of African Americans and most women.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model has been able to shed light on the instutional sexism and racism that occrurs. When analyzing the error for the model, it was obvious to me that there is not a lot of outliers when it came to women and African Americans. Most of them based of their age, education, and family status it is easier to predict whether their income would be greater than or less than 50K. Compared to Males and Caucassians, where there are a lot of outliers. To me it seems as though there are a lot of Males and Caucassians whom the model predicts based on their age, education, and family status should not be making more than 50K but instead they actually do. It also predicts those who should be making more than 50K as making less than 50K.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has led me to conclude that it may not be possible to accurately predict a Male's or a Caucassian's income just by their age, education, and family status since there are a lot of other factors that would go in. However, it is more likely to be able to predicts that of a woman's or an African American's since it's simple if you do not have have a certain amount of higher education as a Female or an African American your likelhood of getting paid more than 50K is slim to none. Even after that they have to prove themselves better and work harder and there is a profile that they have to meet in order to get to the level of the Caucassians and Males, and for that reason it is easeir to predict their income.
