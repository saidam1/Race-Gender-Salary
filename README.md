# Race-Gender-Salary

## Overview 
Is it possible for us to create a machine learning algorithm that will estimate someone's salary based on their education, family status, and race?

You would not be surprised if someone were to tell you that men get paid higher than women in the work industry, or that Caucasians get paid higher than African Americans. It has just become a fact at this point. Are there exceptions to this? If not is there a way for us to predict what a person is making based on their age, education, gender and race? If so how accurate will it be?

## Goals

* Shine light on the pay discrimination that occurs in the workplace.
* Try to use predicting models to really understand the discrimination in pay when it comes to race and gender.

## Motivation & Background

There was a big schock in the United States and the world when Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election. It shed light onto the racisim and sexism that has been long instilled in a lot of Americans and it has been passed generations to generations and is still happening. Four long years later we are back again in the midst of the elections for the 2020 presidential election. Now more than ever we see the racism not just in America but around the world increasing at a rapid rate. Maybe it's not actually increasing, but people are not afraid to show how they truly feel when there is a president that is blatantly supporting White Supremacy and Male superiority. 

The past two reports that I had done ties with racism in America. This one will dive a little deeper to see the instutitionalized discrimination that occurs when it comes to salary bias to African Americans and Women in the United States.
